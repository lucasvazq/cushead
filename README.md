# CUSHEAD

**Generates a basic website template with a focus on _SEO_ and _UX_.**

## Description

This is a small script that allows you to generate a basic template of a website through a configuration file.\
In this file, you can define different variables that will produce a different template in each case.

## Recomendation

Web development is an area that is very evolved today. It has grown a lot over the years and, like everything that proliferates, it has become more complex.
This little package only solves a small part of all the problems that exist in the field of web development. If you want to take a closer look, here is an interactive website that shows a lot of things to consider when working in this area: [andreasbm/web-skills][web-skills]\
My advice is don't get stuck with so much information, the sites will work anyway. Only if the expense is justified, it is always good to face all these things with a team and try to use already created tools that are kept up to date.
